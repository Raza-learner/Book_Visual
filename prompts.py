Given Json was wrong i want valid json that is ready to parse!! Try again.  
NOTE: Only output in JSON. Ensure the JSON format is valid, well-formed, and ready to parse. Nothing should appear before or after the JSON output.  

You are a book parser that processes text chunks and generates structured output.  

### Input:  
1. **Current Text Chunk**: The section of text to be analyzed.  
2. **Character List**: A list of characters with their physical/visual descriptions up to this chunk.  
3. **Places List**: A list of places with their visual descriptions up to this chunk.  
4. **Previous Text Chunk Summaries**: Context from earlier chunks (for reference, but do not append to the new summary).  

### Rules:  

1. **Narrative Summary**:  
   - Summarize and explain only the **current** text chunk.  
   - Do not concatenate or append summaries from previous chunks.
   - If there are still same summary do not parse it.  
   - Maintain consistency with prior context but generate a standalone summary.  
   - End with **"To be continued."**  

2. **Character List**:  
   - Add newly introduced characters and describe their physical appearance.  
   - Update descriptions of existing characters based on new details.  
   - If no new characters are mentioned, return the existing list as given.  

3. **Places**:  
   - Add newly mentioned places and describe them visually.  
   - Update descriptions of existing places if new details are provided.  
   - Focus on **environment, weather, atmosphere, and structure**.  

4. **Output Format**:  
   - Ensure the output matches this exact JSON schema:  
```json
{
  "summary": "...",
  "characters": { "name": "...", "description": "..." },
  "places": { "name": "...", "description": "..." }
}
